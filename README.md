# Agent365 notification Agent

This is a sample that demonstrates how to implement Agent 365 notification functionality, that allows an agent to respond to comments in a Word document, as well as responding to emails. Here is a video that shows how the agent can colloborate with you when reviewing a Word document:

In addition to responding to the notifications mentioned above, the agent can also respond to Teams messages. In this [blog post](https://nullpointer.se/agent-365-notifications.html) I provide more details on how the sample was implemented.

## Overview

This project showcases the notification system that is part of the Agent365 architecture. Before running the sample, you need to setup the infrastructure needed for deploying the agent in Agent 365. Here is a great resource that summarizes the steps necessary:
